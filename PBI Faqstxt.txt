Power BI Desktop Faqs:
====================
Q: Tell me a few differences between import, direct query and connect live?
	Import:
		a) structure and data available in PBI dataset
		b) Limited volumes of data [<1 GB, or < 10GB]
		c) Faster transform, model, secure, visualize options [because data stored in local memory (in-memory)]
		d) Refresh of data mandatory
		e) Report view, Data view, and Model views are available
		e) More features applicable
	Direct query [RDBMS], Connect Lvel [Cubes]:
	
		a) structure only available in PBI dataset
		b) More volumes of data
		c) Slower transform, model, secure, visualize options [because every time hits the source]
		d) Refresh of data is not mandatory [always hits the database and brings data]
		e) Report view and Model views only available [No Data View]
		e) Less features applicable when compared to import mode
